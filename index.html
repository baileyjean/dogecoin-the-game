        <p>"y tho" some of you may ask?</p>
        <p>Well if we learned one thing from 2020, it's that the world's board game market saw an almost one-BILLION-dollar increase in global market value. This very excite & NEW game is fulfilling a critical market need. You're welcome. (wow much demand, such stonks)</p>
        <p>Dogecoin the Game: enjoy this hyperbolic thrill on the rollercoaster ride that is the crypto-market! While the numbers do not reflect any real-life figures--yet--its sporadic and volatile nature stays true to crypto as we experience it today.</p>

      <div class="item-b">
        <p>Of course every game is more fun with a little narrative, so <b>here's the story:</b></p>
        <p><em>Your best friend just got rich on Dogecoin and they want to share the wealth... you lucky doge, you! (wow such friendship)</p>
        <p>Your bestie gave you a nice sum of money, so your bank balance is now $12,000 (wow much wealths). The only stipulation: you MUST join the #dogeArmy and invest some of your small fortune into Dogecoin.</em></p>
        <p>You can invest:</p>
        <p>$1000 | $5000 | $10,000</p>
        <p>And choose from these profit goals:</p>
        <p>$50,000 | $100,000 | $1,000,000</p>
        <p>Only legends beat <b>DOGEFATHER MODE</b>: $1000 investment + $1M profit goal</p>

      <div class="item-d">
        <p><b><u>HOW IT WORKS:</b></u></p>
        <p>There are 20 spaces on the board. You must reach your profit goal by the time you get back to the beginning, AND your bank account cannot hit $0, or you lose. Roll the 4-sided dice to see how far you move.</p>
        <p>On each turn you must pull one of the 84 cards from the DOGE DECK (&trade;)</p>
        <p><b>DOGE DECK (&trade;) Distribution:</b></p>
        <li>The Good Tweet (21 cards)</li>
        <li>The Bad Tweet (21 cards)</li>
        <li>The Doge Miner (19 cards)</li>
        <li>Life Happens (18 cards)</li>
        <li>Robinhood (3 cards)</li>
        <li>Meme Lord (2 cards)</li>
      </div>
      <div class="item-e">
        <p><b>The Good Tweet:</b> The current price of doge rises by a random amount</p>
        <p><b>The Bad Tweet:</b> The current price of doge goes down by 20%</p>
        <p><b>The Doge Miner:</b> The number of dogecoins you have goes up OR stays the same (after all you ARE new at this)</p>
        <p><b>Life Happens:</b> Three of these four cards deplete your bank balance, the other one takes away half your doges, but you won't know why until you pull it (much mystery)</p>
        <p><b>Robinhood:</b> Takes away ONE of your three lives. Three Robinhood cards before you reach the end and you lose</p>
        <p><b>Meme Lord:</b> Find the two Meme Lord cards during your game and you win! ...almost... you still have to reach the finish with at least one life and a non-zero bank balance</p>
