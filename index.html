      <p>Your best friend just got rich on Dogecoin and they want to share the wealth... you lucky doge, you</p>
      <p>Your bank account now has $12,000. Watching your friend succeed has inspired you! (wow)</p>
      <p>You've decided to join the #dogeArmy and ride it TO THE MOON</p>
      <ul>Before you start the game, you have to decide TWO things:</ul>
        <li>What's YOUR version of "to the moon?"</li>
        <li>How much are you willing to invest?</li>  
      <p>Remember: life still happens on the journey to the moon, so invest with caution. But with great risk comes great reward.</p>
