        <p>Dogecoin - the most memeable (& cute) cryptocurrency in history. Now it's a browser-based board game! (wow) Welcome to <em>Dogecoin the Game!!</em></p>
        <p>"y tho" some of you may ask?</p>
        <p>Well if we learned one thing from 2020, it's that the global board game market saw an almost one-BILLION-dollar increase in global market value. This game is fulfilling a critical market need. You're welcome. (wow many supplies and demands, such stonks)</p>
        <p>Dogecoin the Game: enjoy this parabolic thrill of the rollercoaster ride that is the crypto-market! While the numbers do not reflect any real-life figures--yet--its sporadic and volatile nature stays true to crypto as we experience it today.</p>
